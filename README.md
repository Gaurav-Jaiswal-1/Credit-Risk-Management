# Credit Risk Model

## Overview

This project involves creating a credit risk model that categorizes customers into priority levels (P1 to P4) based on their account history. The model is designed to help financial institutions assess the creditworthiness of customers and prioritize them accordingly. 

- **P1**: Best customers who repay their dues on time.
- **P4**: Worst customers with the highest risk of default.

The model uses a Random Forest algorithm to classify customers into these priority levels.

## Key Features

- **Priority Classification:** The model classifies customers into one of four priority levels based on their credit history.
- **High Accuracy:** Achieved an accuracy of 0.99, indicating strong performance and reliability in predicting customer priority.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes the Random Forest algorithm for classification, leveraging its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language for developing and running the model.
- **Scikit-learn:** The library used for implementing the Random Forest algorithm.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array handling.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-risk-model.git
   cd credit-risk-model
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Model:**
   - Prepare your data in the required format.
   - Train the model using the provided scripts or use the pre-trained model included in the repository.
   - Evaluate and test the model on new data.

4. **Results:**
   The model's performance is evaluated with an accuracy of 0.99. This high accuracy indicates that the model is effective in classifying customers into the appropriate priority levels based on their credit history.
